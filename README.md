###  Deployment of IP Geolocation API Service with Docker and Amazon ElastiCache Integration
This project entails the deployment of an IP Geolocation API service within a Docker container, seamlessly integrated with Amazon ElastiCache for enhanced performance and scalability. The API service provides geolocation information based on IP addresses, catering to various use cases such as targeted advertising, fraud detection, and personalized content delivery.

### The Docker command to integrate the Redis service from Amazon ElastiCache while securely retrieving authentication details from AWS Secrets Manager.

```
docker container run \
-d \
-p 8080:8080 \
--name ipgeolocation-api_new1 \
--restart always \
-e REDIS_PORT="6379" \
-e REDIS_HOST="cluster-3.bkdcl1.clustercfg.aps1.cache.amazonaws.com" \
-e APP_PORT="8080" \
-e API_KEY_FROM_SECRETSMANAGER="True" \
-e SECRET_NAME="geolocation_secret1" \
-e SECRET_KEY="geolocation_api_key1" \
-e REGION_NAME="ap-south-1" \
nisha-sugathan/ipgeolocation-api-service:latest

```

### Key Components:

Docker Containerization: The IP Geolocation API service is encapsulated within a Docker container, ensuring consistency and portability across different environments. Docker enables easy deployment and management of the application, facilitating rapid scaling and updates.

Integration with Amazon ElastiCache: The Docker container is configured to interact with an Amazon ElastiCache Redis cluster for efficient data storage and retrieval. ElastiCache provides a highly available and scalable caching solution, improving the performance and reliability of the API service.

Environment Variables Configuration: The Docker container is launched with several environment variables, including the Redis host and port details (REDIS_HOST and REDIS_PORT), API port (APP_PORT), and configuration for fetching API keys from AWS Secrets Manager (API_KEY_FROM_SECRETSMANAGER, SECRET_NAME, SECRET_KEY, REGION_NAME).

Continuous Availability: The Docker container is configured to restart automatically (--restart always), ensuring continuous availability of the IP Geolocation API service in case of failures or system reboots.

###  Benefits:

Enhanced Performance: Integration with Amazon ElastiCache optimizes data access and reduces latency, resulting in faster response times for geolocation queries.

Scalability: Leveraging Docker containers and Amazon ElastiCache allows for seamless scalability of the IP Geolocation API service to handle increasing user traffic and data volumes.

Secure Key Management: The use of AWS Secrets Manager for storing and retrieving API keys ensures secure access to sensitive information, enhancing data protection and compliance with security best practices.

This project offers a robust and efficient solution for deploying an IP Geolocation API service, leveraging Docker containers and Amazon ElastiCache to deliver high performance, scalability, and security for geolocation-based applications.
